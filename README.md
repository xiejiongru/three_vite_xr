# three_vite_xr
THREE.js + WebXR template using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

Allows testing and modifying [official THREE.js WebXR examples](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webxr) locally, at lightning speed.

## Batteries included

Pre-configured to support :

- WebXR initialization
- glTF file loading
- ammo.js wasm physics library
  - which is fast, but you might consider using the excellent and simpler [Cannon-es](https://fdoganis.github.io/slides/cannon.html) instead
- VSCode launch scripts
- THREE.js type definitions : for IntelliSense in VS Code
- recommended VS Code extensions
- deployment

Have a look at vite.config.js and customize it to your needs (additional libraries, file formats etc.).

## Installation

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

- Clone or download repo
- run `npm install` : fetches and install all dependencies
- `npm run dev` : launches a server and opens your browser in `https://localhost:5173` by default
  - Edit your code : your changes are reflected instantly!
- `npm run build` : packages all code and resources into the `dist` folder, ready for deployment.

## HTTPS

HTTPS is required to use the WebXR API


### Using Cloudflare Tunnel for free without an account or a domain (recommended)

  - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

then follow instructions


```bash
echo >> /Users/XXX/.zprofile

echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/XXX/.zprofile

eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

  - **[Install `cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/)**

```bash
brew install cloudflared
```
- run your app locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

- run `cloudflared` tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173/
```

This will create a random temporary address ending in `*.trycloudflare.com`

You can share this address by sending a link or by generating a QR code (very useful for mobile devices and some XR headsets).

### Persistent link

If you want more persistence, you should register a domain name, or connect your github account to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) for free.

Alternatively, you could simply [use GitHub Pages to host your application persistently](https://sbcode.net/threejs/github-pages/).

### Tunneling alternatives

Check these tunneling alternatives such as `ngrok` or `zrok` for simple personal projects, use [tunneling solutions](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling) 


### Manual HTTPS setup

In order to use `https`, copy your certificates to the `.cert` folder, and change the `serve` command to:

`"serve": "http-server dist -S -C .cert/cert.pem -K .cert/key.pem`

## Deploying the App with GitHub Pages

(original: https://github.com/meta-quest/webxr-first-steps?tab=readme-ov-file#build-and-deploy)

This repository includes a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which automates both the build and deployment to GitHub Pages. Once enabled, every time you push changes to the `main` branch, a new build will automatically be deployed.

#### Steps to Enable GitHub Pages Deployment:

0. **IMPORTANT: Set the `base` variable** in `vite.config.js` (default name `/three_vite_xr`) to the actual name of your repository. Your app will be deployed to https://[GITUSERNAME].github.io/[REPOSITORY_NAME] (for example https://fdoganis.github.io/three_vite_xr)
1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. Navigate to your forked repository’s **Settings**.
3. Scroll down to the **Pages** section.
4. Under **Build and Deployment**, change the **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

Once this is set, GitHub Actions will handle the build and deployment process automatically. Any time you push changes to the `main` branch, the app will be built and deployed to GitHub Pages without any additional manual steps.

You can monitor the status of the deployment job or manually re-run it via the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.

### Deploying to Your Own Hosting Solution

If you prefer to host the app yourself, you’ll need to manually build the app and then deploy the generated files to your hosting provider.

To generate the build, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder containing the static files for the app. You can then upload these files to your hosting platform of choice.
